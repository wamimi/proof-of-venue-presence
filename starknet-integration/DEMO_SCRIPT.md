# WiFiProof Starknet Demo Script

## üéØ What This Demonstrates

A complete zero-knowledge proof system for venue attendance verification on Starknet:
- User connects to venue's captive WiFi portal
- Generates a ZK proof of attendance WITHOUT revealing which specific network
- Proof is verified on-chain on Starknet devnet
- Preserves privacy while proving location/attendance

## üèÜ Perfect for: Privacy & Identity Track

**Privacy Features:**
- ‚úÖ Proves venue attendance without revealing WiFi MAC address
- ‚úÖ User secret remains private
- ‚úÖ Zero-knowledge proof using Noir circuits
- ‚úÖ On-chain verification on Starknet

## üìã Prerequisites (Already Installed)

- Node.js / Bun
- Noir 1.0.0-beta.5
- Barretenberg 0.87.4-starknet.1
- Python 3.10+ with virtualenv
- Garaga 0.18.1
- Starknet Foundry (sncast)
- Starknet Devnet 0.4.3

## üöÄ Demo Flow (5-7 minutes)

### Part 1: Show the Circuit (1 min)

```bash
# Show the WiFiProof circuit
cat circuit/src/main.nr
```

**Key Points to Explain:**
- Circuit takes user_secret, venue_id, event_id, nonce from portal
- Proves you have the secret that matches the nonce WITHOUT revealing it
- Time window validation for proof freshness
- Hash comparisons for integrity

### Part 2: Portal Server Running (30 sec)

```bash
# In terminal 1 - Portal should already be running
cd ../portal-server
node server.js
# Shows: Portal server running on http://localhost:3000
```

**Explain:** This simulates a captive WiFi portal that venue operators run.

### Part 3: Build Circuit & Generate Proof (2 min)

```bash
cd starknet-integration

# Build the Noir circuit
make build-circuit

# Execute circuit with test inputs
make exec-circuit

# Generate ZK proof using Barretenberg (ULTRA_HONK with Starknet support)
make prove-circuit

# Show the proof file
ls -lh circuit/target/proof
# ~14KB proof file
```

**Key Points:**
- Ultra Honk proving system optimized for Starknet
- Proof generation takes ~5 seconds
- Proof is succinct (~14KB for complex circuit)

### Part 4: Generate Cairo Verifier (1 min)

```bash
# Generate verification key
make gen-vk

# Use Garaga to generate Cairo smart contract verifier
make gen-verifier

# Show the generated Cairo verifier
ls -lh contracts/verifier/src/
```

**Explain:** Garaga converts the Noir verifier to Cairo so Starknet can verify proofs.

### Part 5: Deploy to Starknet Devnet (2 min)

```bash
# Terminal 2 - Start Starknet devnet
make devnet
# Shows predeployed accounts and runs on port 5050

# Terminal 3 - Deploy verifier contract
# Activate Python environment
source garaga-venv/bin/activate

# Declare the verifier contract
make declare-verifier
# Note the Class Hash

# Deploy the verifier contract
make deploy-verifier
# Note the Contract Address: 0x058ac88555300d527ac9de972c254f880be16d8af08fbb818ba0c7102464cda6
```

**Key Points:**
- Using local Starknet devnet for testing
- Verifier contract is ~1MB+ (complex Cairo code for BN254 elliptic curve ops)
- This contract can verify WiFiProof ZK proofs on-chain

### Part 6: Verify Proof On-Chain (1 min) ‚≠ê THE MONEY SHOT

```bash
# Generate calldata from proof
make gen-calldata
# Shows 2864 field elements

# Verify the proof on Starknet!
./verify_proof.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Generating calldata...
Calldata generated. Length: 2864 felts

Calling verifier contract...
Success: Call completed

Response: [0x0, 0x7, 0x10932, 0x0, 0x134db3f, ...]
```

**üéâ EXPLAIN THIS IS THE WIN:**
- ‚úÖ Proof was verified ON-CHAIN on Starknet
- ‚úÖ Response contains the public inputs (venue_id, event_id, timestamps)
- ‚úÖ User's privacy is preserved (secret never revealed)
- ‚úÖ Venue attendance is cryptographically proven
- ‚úÖ All computation happens on Starknet network

### Part 7: Show Browser Integration (1 min)

```bash
# Copy artifacts to web app
make artifacts

# Start the web app
make run-app
```

**Navigate to http://localhost:5173**

**Demonstrate:**
1. ‚úÖ Portal integration - Click "Fetch Portal Nonce"
   - Shows it fetches from real portal server
2. ‚úÖ Witness generation works in browser
   - User inputs are processed by Noir circuit
3. üöß Proof generation (explain this is work-in-progress)
   - Command-line proving works (as shown above)
   - Browser proving optimization is in the roadmap

**Explain:** This shows the full UX flow we're building toward.

## üé¨ Key Talking Points for Judges

### Privacy & Identity Track Fit:
1. **Privacy-Preserving Proofs**: User proves attendance without revealing sensitive WiFi data
2. **Identity Management**: Each user has a secret that proves their identity without exposing it
3. **Real-World Application**: Captive portals, event ticketing, location-based rewards
4. **Zero-Knowledge**: Complete ZK proof system from circuit to on-chain verification

### Technical Achievements:
1. ‚úÖ Built a complete Noir circuit for WiFiProof
2. ‚úÖ Integrated with Barretenberg proving system (Ultra Honk)
3. ‚úÖ Used Garaga to generate Cairo verifier for Starknet
4. ‚úÖ Successfully deployed and verified proofs on Starknet devnet
5. ‚úÖ Portal server integration for real captive portal simulation
6. ‚úÖ Browser-based witness generation

### Innovation:
- First WiFi captive portal proof system on Starknet
- Bridges physical location (WiFi) with blockchain identity
- Privacy-preserving attendance/location proofs

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap (Show You're Thinking Ahead)

### Short-term (Next 2 weeks):
- [ ] Optimize in-browser proof generation with UltraHonkBackend
- [ ] Add wallet integration (Argent, Braavos) for transaction signing
- [ ] Deploy to Starknet Sepolia testnet

### Medium-term (Next 1-2 months):
- [ ] Support multiple venue types (conferences, concerts, coworking spaces)
- [ ] Implement proof aggregation for multiple check-ins
- [ ] Create venue operator dashboard

### Long-term Vision:
- [ ] Mainnet deployment
- [ ] Integration with actual captive portal systems (UniFi, Meraki, etc.)
- [ ] NFT badges for attendance milestones
- [ ] Privacy-preserving loyalty/rewards programs

## üìä Demo Tips

1. **Start with the problem**: "How do you prove you attended an event without revealing personal data?"
2. **Show the working parts**: Focus on what works (on-chain verification)
3. **Be honest about WIP**: "Browser proving is optimization work, core system works"
4. **Emphasize privacy**: This is a PRIVACY & IDENTITY project
5. **Show the receipt**: The successful Starknet transaction is proof it works!

## üéØ Final Message to Judges

"WiFiProof demonstrates a complete privacy-preserving proof system on Starknet. While we're still optimizing browser-based proving, the core achievement is clear: we can generate zero-knowledge proofs of venue attendance and verify them on-chain, all while preserving user privacy. This opens up new possibilities for privacy-preserving identity and location-based applications on Starknet."
