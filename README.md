# WiFi Connection Proof

**Privacy-preserving venue presence verification using Zero-Knowledge proofs**

Generate cryptographic proofs that you were at a specific venue without revealing your device identity or location history.

## What This Does

This system proves venue presence during a specific time window while protecting privacy. Your device identity and exact timing stay hidden, but you can cryptographically prove you were at a venue during a valid time window. Each proof has a unique nullifier to prevent replay attacks.

The system generates real cryptographic proofs using Noir circuits and the Barretenberg Ultra Honk proving system.

## Current Status

**Version 1 Demo Features:**
- Real Zero-Knowledge Proofs using Barretenberg cryptography
- Web interface for generating and verifying proofs  
- Ultra-efficient circuit with only 36 ACIR opcodes
- Privacy-first design where no personal data leaves your device

**Note**: This version uses dummy test data for demonstration. Version 2 will integrate with real WiFi data sources and venue attestation systems.

## System Architecture

**What's Currently Working:**
- Zero-Knowledge Circuit: Fully functional 36 ACIR opcodes Noir circuit with real cryptographic proof generation
- Barretenberg Integration: Complete Ultra Honk proof system (6073 constraints) using bb CLI commands
- Local Development: Full Noir compilation, witness generation, and cryptographic proving on localhost
- Frontend Interface: Complete web UI with form validation, proof generation, and verification
- East African Time Support: Timezone-aware timestamp handling (GMT+3)
- Hybrid Deployment: Frontend can be deployed anywhere, backend requires native binary support

**Technology Stack:**
- ZK Framework: Noir v1.0.0-beta.6 with Barretenberg proving backend
- Circuit: Custom venue presence proof with nullifier system
- Backend: Express.js with native Noir/Barretenberg CLI integration
- Frontend: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with responsive design
- Package Manager: pnpm for dependency management

**Current Limitations:**
1. Venue Authentication: Uses simplified hash-based signatures (not real EdDSA/ECDSA)
2. Network Validation: Basic SSID hash check (not actual WiFi network verification)
3. Device Binding: Simple user secret (not hardware-based attestation)
4. Backend Requirements: Requires local environment with Noir and Barretenberg installed
5. Time Windows: Hardcoded conference scenarios (not dynamic venue scheduling)
6. QR Code System: Not yet implemented (planned for next phase)

## Development Roadmap

**Phase 1: Enhanced Security**
- Implement proper EdDSA signature verification in circuit
- Add hardware-based device attestation
- Create secure venue onboarding system with real cryptographic keys
- Add proper network proximity verification

**Phase 2: QR Code Integration**
- Build venue QR code generator tool for conference/venue operators
- Add QR scanner functionality to frontend for easy venue attestation
- Implement venue signature verification from QR codes
- Create venue management dashboard

**Phase 3: Production Infrastructure**
- Deploy backend to cloud environment supporting native binaries
- Add proof verification API for third-party integrators
- Implement proof storage and retrieval system
- Add batch verification capabilities

**Phase 4: Real-World Deployment**
- Conduct pilot with actual venues (coffee shops, conferences, offices)
- Add mobile app support with NoirJS integration
- Implement venue analytics and reporting
- Add support for multiple venue networks and roaming

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Noir** (required for local development):
   ```bash
   curl -L https://install.aztec.network | bash
   noirup
   ```

2. **Install Node.js and pnpm**:
   ```bash
   # Install Node.js (v16+)
   # Then install pnpm
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

### Run the Demo

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wifiproof
cd wifiproof

# Install all dependencies (main, portal, and client)
npm run install:all

# Compile the Noir circuit
nargo compile

# Start the main server (Terminal 1)
npm start

# Start the portal server (Terminal 2)
npm run portal

# Open the demos:
# - Main interface: http://localhost:3001
# - NoirJS Client: http://localhost:3001/client/noirjs/
```

### Captive Portal Demo

The enhanced system now includes a **captive portal simulation** with real cryptographic security:

1. **Portal Server** (`localhost:3002`) - Issues cryptographically signed nonces
2. **NoirJS Client** - Generates proofs in the browser using portal nonces
3. **zkVerify Integration** - Submits proofs to zkVerify for on-chain verification

### Test with Demo Data

#### NoirJS Client Demo:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/client/noirjs/`
2. Click "ðŸŽ« Test Portal Nonce" to verify portal connectivity
3. Set your time window (defaults: 2 hours ago to 1 hour from now)
4. Click "ðŸš€ Generate & Submit Proof" for full end-to-end demo

#### Original Server Demo:
The original interface comes pre-loaded with realistic test data:

```
User Secret: 12345
Connection Nonce: 99999
Venue ID: 67890
Network SSID Hash: 111222333444555
Time Window Start: [2 hours ago] (auto-filled)
Time Window End: [1 hour from now] (auto-filled)
Proof Timestamp: [30 minutes ago] (auto-filled)
```

### Testing Commands

Test the portal endpoints directly:

```bash
# Test nonce issuance (should succeed from localhost)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/issue-nonce \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

# Test from remote IP (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/issue-nonce \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Forwarded-For: 8.8.8.8" \
  -d '{}'

# Test proof submission (replace nonce with actual value)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/submit-proof \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "proof_hex": "0x1234...",
    "public_inputs_hex": "0x5678...",
    "vk_hex": "0x9abc...",
    "portal_nonce": "a1b2c3d4..."
  }'

# Run the test suite
npm test
```

### How It Works

#### Enhanced Captive Portal Flow:
1. **Portal Nonce**: Client requests signed nonce from portal server
2. **Signature Verification**: Browser verifies portal signature using WebCrypto
3. **Proof Generation**: NoirJS generates ZK proof in browser including portal nonce
4. **Proof Submission**: Portal validates nonce and forwards to zkVerify
5. **Privacy Preserved**: User secrets never leave the browser

#### Original Flow:
1. **Generate Proof**: Click "Generate ZK Proof" in the web interface
2. **Real Cryptography**: The system uses Noir + Barretenberg to create an actual ZK proof
3. **Verify Proof**: Use the verification tab to confirm the proof is valid
4. **Privacy Preserved**: Your device secret never leaves your machine

## Privacy Model

**Private Inputs (Hidden):**
- Your device secret (never leaves browser)
- Connection nonce
- Exact proof timing

**Public Outputs (Revealed):**
- Venue ID you're proving presence at
- Event ID from portal
- Portal nonce hash (proves portal interaction)
- Portal signature hash (prevents forgery)
- Valid time window for the event
- Proof nullifier (prevents reuse)

**Enhanced Security:**
- Portal nonces prevent off-site proof generation
- ECDSA P-256 signatures ensure portal authenticity
- Single-use nonces prevent replay attacks
- Local IP restrictions for nonce issuance

## Deployment

The system uses a hybrid deployment model:
- **Frontend**: Can be deployed as static files anywhere (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
- **Backend**: Requires environment supporting native binaries (Railway, Render with Docker, local development)

For development, everything runs on localhost:3001. For production, the frontend calls your backend API explicitly.

## Technical Implementation

The system generates real cryptographic proofs through this workflow:

1. **Circuit Logic** (`src/main.nr`): Proves you know a secret and were present during a valid time window
2. **Noir Compilation**: `nargo compile` creates the circuit
3. **Proof Generation**: `bb prove` generates the cryptographic proof  
4. **Verification**: `bb verify` confirms the proof is valid

All cryptographic operations use industry-standard Barretenberg proving system with Ultra Honk scheme.

## Version Progression

**V2 (Next)**: Real-world integration with QR codes, mobile WiFi data, and venue onboarding system

## Technology Stack
